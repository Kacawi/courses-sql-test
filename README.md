# SQL testing course

Course to experiment with SQL.

This repo will be used to experiment with the latest updates on frontend, backend and main app side.

Some remarks:

- A database can be set up in `requirements.sh`; there's an example of a dummy and a realistic database.
- You can use the `connect()` function to connect to a database in the pre exercise code. Use the name of the database that you specified in `requirements.sh`.
- The `sqlwhat` and `sqlbackend` installs are currently still included in the course requirements. At some point these should be moved the the 'shared container specification', but this way of doing things makes testing new versions less cumbersome.
- TabExercise and BulletExercise should already be supported in frontend and on the session management side, but the main app does not support the concept of 'subexercises' yet.
